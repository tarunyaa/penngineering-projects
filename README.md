## Penngineering Projects

### Metal Detector
*A working metal detector was designed, simulated, built and demonstrated from scratch, as part of the ESE 3190 Final Project.*

<span style="color:purple">Oscillators</span> were used to produce output sinusoidal waveforms whose frequency difference, w<sub>1</sub>-w<sub>2</sub>, increased as a function of the proximity of the metal to the detector. A <span style="color:purple">mixer</span> combined the oscillation frequencies into one signal, a <span style="color:purple">CS amplifier</span> produced different mathematical combinations of the oscillation frequencies, including the frequency difference, w<sub>1</sub>-w<sub>2</sub>, which was filtered by a <span style="color:purple">low pass filter</span>, amplified by the <span style="color:purple">driver</span> and outputted by the <span style="color:purple">speaker</span>.

Multiple simulations were conducted on LTSpice and the different stages of the metal detector circuitry were breadboarded in previous labs before the layout of the components on Altium was done for the creation of a printed circuit board (PCB).
