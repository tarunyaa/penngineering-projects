## Penngineering Projects

### Metal Detector
<span style="color:red">
*A working metal detector was designed, simulated, built and demonstrated from scratch, as part of the ESE 3190 Final Project.*

Oscillators were used to produce output sinusoidal waveforms whose frequency difference, w1-w2, increased as a function of the proximity of the metal to the detector. A mixer combined the oscillation frequencies into one signal, a CS amplifier produced different mathematical combinations of the oscillation frequencies, including the frequency difference, w1-w2, which was filtered by a Low Pass Filter, amplified by the Driver and outputted by the speaker

Multiple simulations were conducted on LTSpice and the different stages of the metal detector circuitry were breadboarded in previous labs before the layout of the components on Altium was done for the creation of a printed circuit board (PCB).
